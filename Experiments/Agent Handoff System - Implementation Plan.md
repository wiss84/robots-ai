# Agent Handoff System - Implementation Plan

## **Concept Overview**

Enable seamless switching between specialized agents when users ask questions outside an agent's domain expertise. Instead of saying "I can't help with that," agents can intelligently hand off users to the appropriate specialized agent while preserving relevant context.

## **Core Features**

### **1. Agent Awareness**
- Each agent knows about other agents and their specializations (via system prompt)
- Agents can recognize when questions are outside their domain
- Agents can suggest appropriate handoffs by mentioning the target agent's name or id in their response

### **2. Smart Context Transfer**
- Filter conversation history to only include relevant context
- Avoid transferring irrelevant information (code to non-coding agents, etc.)
- Always preserve and transfer the user's current question; optionally include a few recent relevant turns if needed for context

### **3. Seamless UI Transitions**
- Smooth agent switching in the chat interface
- Maintain conversation flow
- Allow easy return to previous agents

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Phase 1: Basic Agent Handoff (Hybrid Approach)**
1. **Create Agent Directory**
   - Use the existing agent definitions in AgentSelection.tsx (names, ids, keywords)
   - Ensure each agent's domain and keywords are up to date

2. **Implement Domain Detection (Hybrid)**
   - **Frontend Keyword-Based Switching:**
     - Use the keywords from AgentSelection.tsx to detect when a user query matches another agent's domain
     - Instantly switch to the appropriate agent and pass the user query as a new message
   - **Agent-Initiated Handoff via System Prompt:**
     - Update each agent's system prompt to include awareness of all other agents and their domains
     - Instruct agents: If a user query is outside your domain and fits another agent's domain, respond with a message like: "Your question is outside my domain. Let me switch you to my coworker agent [agent_name or id] who specializes in this domain."
     - The frontend listens for this pattern, extracts the agent id/name, and performs the switch, passing the user query to the new agent

3. **Basic Context Transfer**
   - Always transfer the current user question to the new agent
   - Optionally, transfer the last 2-3 relevant conversation turns if needed for context (filtered by domain relevance)
   - Pass basic user information if required

### **Phase 2: Smart Context Filtering**
1. **Context Classification System**
   - Create rules for what context is relevant to each domain (start with hardcoded keyword checks)
   - Implement filtering logic in backend or frontend as needed

2. **Domain-Specific Filters**
   - Finance Agent: Only financial, investment context
   - Coding Agent: Only technical, code-related context
   - Real Estate Agent: Only property, location context
   - Image Agent: Only visual, image generation, design-related context
   - Games Agent: Only game-related context
   - News Agent: Only latest, current news related context
   - Shopping Agent: Only item shopping related context
   - Travel Agent: Only travel, hotels, places to visit context

### **Phase 3: Enhanced UI & UX**
1. **Smooth Transitions**
   - Update active agent in frontend
   - Handle conversation state management (store history per agent)
   - Add visual indicators for agent switches

2. **Return Path**
   - Allow users to switch back to previous agents
   - Maintain conversation threads for each agent

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
1. **Proactive Suggestions**
   - Agents suggest other agents when relevant
   - "Since you're buying an investment property, you might also want to discuss financing options..."

2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
   - Enable multiple agents to work on complex requests (future phase)
   - Document requirements for multi-agent UI (e.g., multiple pose containers, agent-targeted messages)

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend Changes**
```python
# New files to create:
- agent_handoff.py          # Handoff logic and context filtering
- agent_directory.py        # Agent capabilities and domain mapping (can be synced with frontend definitions)
- context_filter.py         # Context filtering rules (start with hardcoded rules)
```

### **Frontend Changes**
```typescript
// New/updated components to create:
- AgentSwitcher.tsx        # UI for agent switching
- ContextTransfer.tsx      # Handle context transfer display
- Update logic in ChatUI to listen for agent handoff messages and perform agent switch
```

## **Example User Flow**

1. **User asks Real Estate Agent about financing**
2. **Frontend detects finance keywords and switches to Finance Agent, or Real Estate Agent responds with a handoff message mentioning Finance Agent**
3. **Frontend parses the handoff, switches UI to Finance Agent, and passes the user query (and optionally recent relevant turns)**
4. **Finance Agent receives the context and responds**

## **Success Metrics**

- Reduced "I can't help with that" responses
- Increased user satisfaction with seamless transitions
- Higher completion rates for complex multi-domain requests
- Positive user feedback on agent collaboration

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Intelligent Routing**: AI-powered agent selection
- **Context Learning**: Improve filtering based on user feedback
- **Agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents working together on complex tasks (future phase)
- **Personalized Handoffs**: Learn user preferences for agent switching
