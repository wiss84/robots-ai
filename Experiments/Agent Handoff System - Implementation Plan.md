# Agent Handoff System - Implementation Plan

## **Concept Overview**

Enable seamless switching between specialized agents when users ask questions outside an agent's domain expertise. Instead of saying "I can't help with that," agents can intelligently hand off users to the appropriate specialized agent while preserving relevant context.

## **Core Features**

### **1. Agent Awareness**
- Each agent knows about other agents and their specializations
- Agents can recognize when questions are outside their domain
- Agents can suggest appropriate handoffs

### **2. Smart Context Transfer**
- Filter conversation history to only include relevant context
- Avoid transferring irrelevant information (code to non-coding agents, etc.)
- Preserve user's current question and relevant background

### **3. Seamless UI Transitions**
- Smooth agent switching in the chat interface
- Maintain conversation flow
- Allow easy return to previous agents

## **Implementation Steps**

### **Phase 1: Basic Agent Handoff**
1. **Create Agent Directory**
   - Define each agent's domain and capabilities
   - Create mapping of question types to appropriate agents

2. **Implement Domain Detection**
   - Add logic to detect when questions are outside current agent's domain
   - Create handoff suggestion logic

3. **Basic Context Transfer**
   - Transfer only the current user question
   - Pass basic user information

### **Phase 2: Smart Context Filtering**
1. **Context Classification System**
   - Create rules for what context is relevant to each domain
   - Implement filtering logic

2. **Domain-Specific Filters**
   - Finance Agent: Only financial, real estate, investment context
   - Coding Agent: Only technical, code-related context
   - Real Estate Agent: Only property, location context
   - Image Agent: Only visual, design-related context
   - Chess Agent: Only game-related context

### **Phase 3: Enhanced UI & UX**
1. **Smooth Transitions**
   - Update active agent in frontend
   - Handle conversation state management
   - Add visual indicators for agent switches

2. **Return Path**
   - Allow users to switch back to previous agents
   - Maintain conversation threads for each agent

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features**
1. **Proactive Suggestions**
   - Agents suggest other agents when relevant
   - "Since you're buying an investment property, you might also want to discuss financing options..."

2. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
   - Enable multiple agents to work on complex requests
   - Coordinate responses from different specialists

## **Technical Architecture**

### **Backend Changes**
```python
# New files to create:
- agent_handoff.py          # Handoff logic and context filtering
- agent_directory.py        # Agent capabilities and domain mapping
- context_filter.py         # Context filtering rules
```

### **Frontend Changes**
```typescript
// New components to create:
- AgentSwitcher.tsx        # UI for agent switching
- ContextTransfer.tsx      # Handle context transfer display
```

### **Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- New tables:
- agent_handoffs           # Track handoff history
- conversation_contexts    # Store filtered context per agent
```

## **Example User Flow**

1. **User asks Real Estate Agent about financing**
2. **Real Estate Agent detects domain mismatch**
3. **Agent suggests handoff to Finance Agent**
4. **System filters context (removes code, images, chess moves)**
5. **Transfers relevant context (property details, investment intent)**
6. **Switches UI to Finance Agent**
7. **Finance Agent receives filtered context and responds**

## **Success Metrics**

- Reduced "I can't help with that" responses
- Increased user satisfaction with seamless transitions
- Higher completion rates for complex multi-domain requests
- Positive user feedback on agent collaboration

## **Future Enhancements**

- **Intelligent Routing**: AI-powered agent selection
- **Context Learning**: Improve filtering based on user feedback
- **Agent Collaboration**: Multiple agents working together on complex tasks
- **Personalized Handoffs**: Learn user preferences for agent switching
